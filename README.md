# SQL Bak Version

SQL Bak Version is a tool designed to analyze the header of SQL Server backup files (.bak) and determine the SQL Server version without the need for a preinstalled SQL Server instance. This tool is particularly useful for quickly identifying the SQL Server version of backup files without the need to restore them or rely on a SQL Server installation.

## Features
- Analyze the header of SQL Server backup files.
- Determine the SQL Server version based on specific byte patterns within the file.
- Display the detected SQL Server version in a user-friendly manner.


## How It Works
SQL Bak Version reads the binary content of the SQL Server backup file and analyzes specific byte patterns to determine the SQL Server version. By interpreting these byte sequences, it extracts the version information without the need for a preinstalled SQL Server instance.
